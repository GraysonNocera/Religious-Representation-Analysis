            Temple Run was launched to the app store in 2011. The app is the brainchild of Keith Shepherd and Natalia Luckyanova, a married couple of software developers. Through their company Imangi Studios, they created several apps before Temple Run. Some were successful, others were unsuccessful. Eventually, they settled on the story of Temple Run. An explorer in the jungle steals a golden idol from a temple, only to be chased by Evil Demon Monkeys as a result. It was a smash hit, becoming the number one free app on the iOS app store. By June 2014, the Temple Run games combined had been downloaded over 1 billion times.
